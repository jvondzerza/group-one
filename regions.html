                </h1>
                <p>
                    Peppers are native to tropical America and are particularly important in the cuisines of tropical Asia and equatorial America. Traces of pepper fruits have been found in prehistoric remains in Peru and Mexico,
                    and the plants were widely grown in Central and South America by various pre-Columbian civilizations.
                    Originally mistaken for a form of black pepper (Piper nigrum),
                    the first pepper seeds were carried to Spain in 1493 and from there spread rapidly throughout Europe and the rest of the world.

                <h2>Bird's Eye Chili</h2>
                <p>
                    The tiny Bird’s Eye Chili originated in Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, The Philippines, and surrounding countries, but they can now be found all over the world. They are presumably called Bird’s Eye Chili because of their small round shape and because they have been spread by birds, which are not affected by the heat of the peppers.

                    The Chiltepin pepper in North America is also known by the same name, and for the same reasons, but it is a different pepper altogether.

                    The Bird’s Eye are generally red at maturity, but may also be yellow, purple or black. They are very popular in cuisine from the areas mentioned above, and with heat almost similar to a habanero, they add quite a punch to many types of dishes, including pastas, soups, sauces, dips, and more.

                    Historically the hot pepper has been used as a natural remedy for arthritis, rheumatism, flatulence and toothache, and they may be used as an insect repellent when mixed with water.

                <h2>Sugar Rush Chili Pepers</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a rare Peach colored Capsicum bacattum variety from Peru that is very sweet. The heat level approaches habanero, but does not quite achieve it. It might be the only Peach colored Aji type we have ever seen. It is similar to the Aji Amarillo but much sweeter, which is why it’s called Sugar Rush.
                    The Sugar Rush Chili plants will grow over 5 feet tall and will need staking. Like many Aji’s they have a long season but produce many peppers into the fall.

                <h2>Bradley Bahamian Pepper</h2>
                <p>
                    Bradley’s Bahamian is a Tabasco type pepper that grows in the Bahamas and surrounding Caribbean Islands.
                    The peppers have Tabasco heat but are slightly sweeter in taste. Very productive and makes a nice potted patio chile plant.
                    Peppers ripen from green to an orange red color. They get a little over an inch in length and less than a 1/4 inch in diameter.

                <h2>Fatalii Chili Peppers</h2>
                <p>
                    The Fatalii comes from central and southern Africa, and is one of the hottest peppers in the world.
                    With the heat level of a habanero, it has a more fruity, citrus flavor, and packs an instant, intense burn, unlike the habanero, whose heat “sneaks up on you.”
                    The peppers grow to about 3 inches long, and mature to yellow. They have somewhat thin walls, and may be dried if cut lengthwise.
                    They could be made into a powder for an intense spice, or frozen for later use.
