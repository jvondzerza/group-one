## Introduction 

The HotBoss project was created to demo a webshop that sells chili pepper seeds to customers looking to cultivate pepper plants. The project is composed by 6 HTML files (index, about, product, regions, contact and thank-you), a "css" folder in which there are 6 CSS files (index, about, product, regions, contact and thank-you) and an "img" folder containing all the image files used in the site's current build. 

## About the HTML files 
1. The index page serves as the landing page for our website. 

2. The about page details the business’s mission, promise and ethos. 

3. The products page presents the four kind of chili peppers that HotBoss sells. Each pepper has a little description and a price table, and the user can buy seeds by clicking on the button “Buy your package here”, which redirects the user to the contact page. The “Learn more about this chili pepper” button redirects the user to the regions page. 

4. The regions page presents a littles story about the origin and the characteristics of each chili pepper that HotBoss sells. Each description of the peppers has the button “Buy your package here” that redirects the customer to the products page. 

5. The contact page has a form where the customer can send an email to the adress hotboss.pepper@gmail.com and making his/her order of seeds. In this form the customer enters a name, surname and a message deatiling their order. The user then clicks on the "Submit" button and the order is sent to the HotBoss email and the customer is redirected to the "Thank you" page. There are also a phone number, that the customer can use to call HotBoss shop, a mailto link and Facebook and Instagram links(dummy). 

6. The thank-you.html is a page where HotBoss thanks for the customer’ order or contact. There is also a link that redirect the customer to the home page.
